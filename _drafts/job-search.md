Why does getting a job in any field require marketing skills?

Can we be fair and require sales positions to require, say, calculus?

In web development, there are too many languages, frameworks, etc. Sure, there
are a few that are more common than others (React, WordPress), but this makes it
difficult for even the most experienced developer to meet listed job requirements.

What's worse is jobs that do not list meaningful requirements. This is likely
often due to the job description being written by someone of a less technical
background.

On Upwork, it's usually **far** worse. Don't bother posting a job if the description
is, "Looking for someone to build/maintain our website" or anything similar. At
least qualify with the stack to be familiar with.
