I've been a Firefox user for a very long time now. I know that the popular thing
these days is for tech bloggers to talk about finally giving Firefox a try again
with the release of Quantum after years of using Chrome, but I haven't used Chrome
very much in a very long time.

For a long time now, Firefox has performed far better than Chrome for me. In fact,
if I have Chrome running, it had better be the only thing I have open because
it **will** cause my computer to crash. This is because Chrome runs every tab
in a separate process, which is why it is a memory hog.

There are other reasons for my preference as well, such as support for RSS
(I'm enough of a fan of RSS that I made an add-on called [Awesome RSS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/awesome-rss/)).
Firefox also allows me to set a master password, which is an absolute necessity
when using [Portable Apps](https://www.portableapps.com). And that's not even
mentioning the privacy concerns of having the largest online advertiser as the
maker of your browser.

I've heard Chrome praised for it's speed and standards support which, in 2008 and
a few years thereafter, was valid praise. To an extent, this still is true. But,
if you were to remove Chrome from running at startup, do you still think that it
would have impressive startup times? Is it still fair to praise Chrome for its
support of web standards when Google implements a feature of their own creation
before it has gone through the standards process? And, which browser maker was
it that introduced WebVR and ASM.js (hint: Mozilla).

In my experience and opinion, part of this is also due to "UA sniffing." Because
Chrome has the reputation of being the best browser, many bad developers will
serve different content or disable features to browsers that are not Chrome.
Amazon did this before with their Kindle app. Netflix did it with their HTML5
playback (even after Firefox added DRM). Google still does this with many of
their products (Inbox, Music).

On mobile, the dominance of Chrome (really, the Webkit family) is even more obvious
and detrimental. I've seen far too many sites that are exclusively Webkit. Perhaps
what's more frustrating still is when everything is `-webkit-` prefixed even when
the standardized feature has been supported for years now. Try any non-webkit
browser on your phone and check out Gmail to see what I mean.
