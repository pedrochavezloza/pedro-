# Building Web Apps
![dev](/img/uploads/code-design.png)

I've long been opposed to the term, "Web App". Like so many terms in web development,
it is a collection of words that has a meaning, yet does not add any meaning to
what is being said - a "buzzword."

"App", short for application, has a few meanings that could be called fitting:
- A computer program or the set of software that the end user perceives as a single entity as a tool for a well-defined purpose
- A computer program with a user interface
- A program that gives a computer instructions that provide the user with tools to accomplish a task

So, to be a "Web App", something must:
- Be available on the web
- Have a GUI
- Accomplish a task

With that in mind, what wouldn't be considered a web app? Even the most basic 404
page meets this criteria (*it's task / purpose being to communicate an invalid link*).

To me, calling web pages "Web Apps" is like calling a word processing document an
app because the web is essentially documents available on the network that are
displayed in software designed to view those documents. Microsoft Office and LibreOffice
are the software, not that report you're writing. Think JavaScript changes that?
Do macros make a Word document an app?

On the other hand, the same could be argued for anything considered an app in
the traditional sense because it is run in and depends upon the underlying Operating
System for functionality and rendering.
